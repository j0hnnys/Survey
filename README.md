SE137 Team Project

Survey App Team Project

This survey application has three major features:
  1. The ability to take surveys.
  2. Being able to create your own surveys.
  3. Seeing the results of a survey

The application uses Parse to asynchronously update data onto its Parse database, so an internet connection is required to use it. It includes a sign up feature that allows you to create an account in order to log in to the application.
